            <ul>
                <li>Apartment Search & Lease Signing: MoveMate will help immigrants find suitable housing, guiding them through the process of selecting apartments, handling the paperwork, and signing leases.
</li>
                <li>Reduced Deposits: For those using the Full Package, MoveMate will offer the option to secure housing with a small deposit included in the package, easing the financial burden. The tenant only needs to cover monthly rent and utilities (electricity, gas, water, internet).
</li>
                <li>Temporary Housing Options: If permanent housing is not immediately available, we will assist in securing temporary housing or rentals.
